# Review

Judge the change against its spec, by a reader not biased by how the work was done. In these steps, `ourkit <subcommand>` means `node .ourkit/kit/bin/ourkit.js <subcommand>`, run from the project root.

## Before you start

1. Run `ourkit pending`. If it prints anything, mention that line to the user.
2. Run `ourkit tier show` and `ourkit mode`.
3. Run `ourkit gate floor`. If it blocks, this change can't stay a Patch, so raise its Tier first.

## Who reviews

- **Feature or Epic:** start the `ourkit-reviewer` subagent. Tell it only to review the Active Change. Don't explain the work, share your reasoning or mention what you're worried about, because a fresh view is the point.
- **Touching a Sensitive Area:** also start the `ourkit-sensitive-reviewer` subagent, the same way.
- **Patch:** review it yourself. Read `ourkit review packet`, then judge the diff against its checklists as strictly as if someone else had written it.

## Handling findings

1. Record each finding with `ourkit review add <blocking|non-blocking> "<finding>"`. Keep the Reviewer's file, line and failure scenario in the text. Don't downgrade or drop a finding because it's inconvenient. If you think it's wrong, verify that against the code first.
2. **Fix blocking findings.** Delegate each fix to the `ourkit-implementer` subagent, verify it, then run `ourkit review resolve <id>`. Resolve a finding only when it's fixed, or you've verified it's wrong and can say why.
   - In Pair, ask the user if a fix is a judgment call.
   - In Hands-off, make at most two attempts, then stop and add it to the Question Batch (ADR 0009).
3. **Report non-blocking findings.** In Pair, ask whether to act on them. In Hands-off, list them in your report, and don't act on them unless they're trivial.
4. **Review again if you changed code.** Anything fixed needs a fresh look, since a fix can break something else.

## Finishing

When no blocking finding is left, run `ourkit review complete`, then `ourkit gate review`. The Gate blocks if a blocking finding is unresolved or if the change has moved since it was reviewed.

A Patch ends here. In Pair, tell the user the result so they can commit it. In Hands-off, continue to Ship to open its PR.

Everything else continues to Ship. In Pair, also suggest that the user runs `/ourkit-huh` if they'd like to understand the change first. Don't push, merge or deploy in this Stage.
